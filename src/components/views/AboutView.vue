        <h1>Here a few Things about me</h1>
        <span>
            <p>As a passionate full-stack intern, I bring a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end
                technologies, combined with a strong academic background in Information Technology. My journey in IT
                began during high school, where I developed an early interest in technology and computing. This
                enthusiasm led me to pursue IT studies through matric and further into varsity, where I honed my skills
                in various programming languages and frameworks.</p>

            <p>Beyond my technical expertise, I am an avid gamer and basketball enthusiast. My love for video games has
                fostered a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of user experience, which translates into my
                work as a developer. Similarly, my involvement in basketball has taught me valuable lessons in teamwork,
                strategic thinking, and perseverance.</p>

            <p>
                I thrive in dynamic environments where I can leverage my technical skills while also drawing from my
                hobbies to bring creativity and problem-solving abilities to the table. My goal is to contribute to
                innovative projects, collaborate with talented teams, and continue growing both professionally and
                personally in the tech industry.
