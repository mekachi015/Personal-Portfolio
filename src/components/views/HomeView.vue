        <h1>Hello this is the home page</h1>
        <p>I am a 25-year-old full-stack intern with a fervent passion for both technology and sports. Currently, I am
            immersing myself in the world of full-stack development, where I leverage my skills to build dynamic,
            user-centric applications. My journey in IT has been fueled by a lifelong curiosity and dedication,
            beginning in high school and continuing through my varsity studies, where I gained comprehensive knowledge
            in various programming languages and development frameworks.</p>

        <p>Originally from Limpopo, I moved to pursue opportunities that would allow me to enhance my skills and broaden
            my horizons. My current role as a full-stack intern is a testament to my commitment to growth and excellence
            in the tech field. I am particularly excited about my involvement in the Shaaper Learnership, which offers a
            platform for practical learning and professional development, aligning perfectly with my career aspirations.
        </p>

        <p>Outside of my professional life, I am an avid gamer and a passionate basketball player. Video games have not
            only been a source of entertainment but also a way for me to understand complex systems and user
            interaction. Basketball, on the other hand, has instilled in me a strong sense of teamwork, strategy, and
            resilienceâ€”qualities that I bring into my work environment.</p>

        <p>Balancing my technical skills with my interests, I am dedicated to contributing to innovative projects,
            collaborating with diverse teams, and continuously evolving as a developer. I am driven by the pursuit of
            excellence and the desire to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
